*This website is under active development.*

Welcome to my data science portfolio! I'm Sebastian and I currently work in the Patient Safety Analysis team at [NHS England:](https://www.england.nhs.uk/about/what-we-do/) the arm's length body responsible for providing national leadership and direction for NHS organisations in England. 

I'm a graduate of the [University of Sheffield](https://sheffield.ac.uk/), where I earned an MSc in Psychological Research Methods with Data Science. I've extended my training in operational research and data science via the Health Service Modelling Associates [(HSMA) Programme](https://hsma.co.uk), delivered by the [NIHR ARC South West Peninsula (PenARC)](https://arc-swp.nihr.ac.uk/about-penarc/).

I'm experienced in collaborative, [Git-based workflows](https://github.com/nhs-england-patient-safety) and recognised for translating complex data into actionable insights across clinical, operational, and policy environments. My technical stack includes Python and R, with strong knowledge of automation, data pipelines and advanced analytics.

This website is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. Incidentally, these same features make it a great template for anyone that needs to show off a professional template!

You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration
