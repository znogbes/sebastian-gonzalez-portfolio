This report provides national statistics on the number of patient safety events reported to the *Learn from Patient Safety Events (LFPSE)*. I have contributed to the development of this quarterly publication, in my role as data analyst in the [patient safety analysis team](https://github.com/nhs-england-patient-safety) at NHS England. 

This report is an example of a fully automated data pipeline (i.e., from data extraction to production) to handle large volumes of data on a regular basis. The publication uses data from over 800,000 events and 18,000+ healthcare organisations in England. This report is produced using `R` and `quarto`, and the code is version-controlled using `Git`.

Latest issue: [Quarter 2 2025/26 (July, August, September 2025)](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/patient-safety-data/2025-26/quarter-2-2025-26-july-august-september-2025/)
